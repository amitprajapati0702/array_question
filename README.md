**# 📘 DSA Array Questions in C++ (LeetCode Practice)**

This repository contains solutions to **popular array-based Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** questions, mainly practiced from **LeetCode**. All problems are implemented in **C++** with a focus on clarity, optimal time complexity, and clean coding style.

---

**## 🚀 Problems Covered**

1. 🔁 **Merge Two Arrays in Decreasing Order**  
   Merges two arrays and sorts the result in descending order.

2. 🔗 **Merge Two Sorted Arrays**  
   Efficiently merges two sorted arrays into one sorted array.

3. 🧹 **Move All Zeros to the Right Side**  
   Rearranges an array to move all zeros to the end while maintaining the order of non-zero elements.

4. 🔄 **Reverse Last N Elements of Array**  
   Reverses the last two (or more) elements of an array.

5. 🔁 **Rotate Array by K Positions**  
   Rotates the elements of an array to the right by a given number of positions.

6. ➕ **Sum of Two Arrays (Digit-wise)**  
   Adds two arrays digit by digit, handling carry like manual addition.
